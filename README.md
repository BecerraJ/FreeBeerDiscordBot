# Free Beer Discord Bot

The purpose of this bot is to handle some of the complex tasks the players perform on discord to handle equipment regears. Bot will find equipment prices based off a users death in game and finds the pricing of each item utilizing www.albion-online-data.com.  

A configured "regear officer" will have the option to approve or deny regears. Regears get logged to a google spreadsheet and or database of their choice.  

This bot was made to only work for ONE server and is not intented as of now to work on multiple servers.
